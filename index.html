Welcome to my website! My name is Timotheus, aka EscapeFromPolesie. This little site will help you get to know me a little bit. 
<br></br>
<p></p>I'm currently working in IT support, and I like to get experience not only with IT but also to improve my communication skills with people. 
I also really like working on Linux, I like the security of IT.</p>
<br></br>
<p></p>I enjoy cycling, history, and genealogy (which I have been doing for a long time). It allows me to learn more about my family, help people find their relatives around the world, and expand my social circle.</p>
<br></br>
</p>Video games have been a constant part of my free time since I was a young child.  Games that I play constantly and consider my favorites are Path of Exile and when I'm feeling centered, I can play a game Hunt: Showdown.
Among the games that I enjoyed and are very good, I can name: Mafia I, Mafia II, Cyberpunk 2077, Deat Stranding, Atomic Heart, Doom, Doom Eternal, Deep Rock Galactic, Days Gone, Elite Dangerous.</p>
<br></br>
<p></p>I don't watch a lot of anime, but there are a few series that have given me great pleasure and can be rewatched many times: Evangelion, Hellsing, Akame ga Kill!, Spy Ã— Family, Castlevania, Chainsaw Man, Kenpu denki beruseruku, Tokyo Ghoul.</p>
<br></br>
<p?I'm also a big fan of sci-fi and space series, perhaps my favorites are: Doctor Who, Battlestar Galactica, The Expanse, Stargate SG-1, Babylon 5, The Orville, Star Trek, Killjoys, Lexx, Farscape, The Mandalorian.</p>
